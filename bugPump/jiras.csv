MB-1677,911344,Create public-facing distro list to use as email address for Flyte packages,MB-1525,"It's common for package registries to have an author/email associated with a package, and these email addresses are usually public.

 

For FlyteIDL, Randy is listed as the author on NPM. This would present a problem if Randy were to leave the company and suddenly the email address is going to the void :)

We should create a publicly-visible distribution list that can be used as a package author contact for things like pypi/npm.
