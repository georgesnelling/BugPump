Over half the time I spend interacting with the Flyte UI is spent copying/pasting inputs from one existing workflow into the ""Launch Workflow"" dialog box (there is [another ticket|https://jira.lyft.net/browse/MB-1804] about that). With this bug, the new UI is practically unusable for me.

We are in a bit of a weird spot right now because the built Docker images are public, but the github repo is private.

 

Some options are:

 * Deprecate/remove the custom image and find a way to use the base image instead.

Date:		2019-10-03 14:59:17 UTC  
By:		bakewell  
Weakness:	Information Disclosure  
  
Details:  
# Summary:
A token was found within a publicly accessible docker image that allows access to Lyft's ""Qubole"" service. This service contains a large number of tables (~7000) containing what appears to be personal customer data, as well as technical information relating to Lyft's infrastructure. Additionally, an SSH key for Lyft's GitHub ""lyft-gitreadonly-go"" account was found, which allows access to private git repos.

##Location:
The affected docker image is:
`lyft/flytepropeller`
The tags containing tokens appear to be all tags with the word ""builder"" on the end and can be accessed using e.g:
`docker pull lyft/flytepropeller:0478cd2e7ccffb718a10c072166db40b69b83441-builder`

This image contains a ""Qubole"" access token within the following files:
```
/go/pkg/dep/sources/ssh---git@github.com-lyft-flytedynamicjoboperator/deploy/cr.yaml
/go/pkg/dep/sources/ssh---git@github.com-lyft-flytedynamicjoboperator/pkg/tests/integration_test.go
```

The token is:
`906e58d1dff048ed89684b086b89a84b294f312069fd4b5887c61e5cfc8dd646`

Additionally, build artefacts for flytepropeller and the source code for the private `lyft/flytequboleoperator` and `lyft/flytedynamicjoboperator` repos are contained within the image.

The GitHub SSH key is located in the docker history of several tags, such as ""v0.2.41-builder""
To check this, run `docker pull lyft/flytepropeller:v0.2.41-builder`, then run `docker image history --no-trunc lyft/flytepropeller:v0.2.41-builder`. You don't need to run the container.

## Impact

#Qubole

The Qubole access token allows access to ~7000 tables, as well as numerous other calls that can be made from the Qubole API. Tables can be accessed using ""Hive"" commands to retrieve the contents. We strictly limited this to avoid accessing customer data, so Lyft will need to investigate themselves to determine the full extent to which customer data or sensitive material could have be exfiltrated by a malicious attacker. A few examples were viewed to determine whether the data was from a development or production environment, and we believe it to be production data based on the presence of several ""wearehackerone"" email addresses in a table, plus references to the word ""production"" scattered about.

As an example, the `dim_enterprise_org_members_v2` table was found to contain email addresses, and the `dim_support_agent_details` showed a name of what we assume to be a support agent.

The Qubole API also allowed us to:
* Execute commands on the underlying cluster host operating system
* View historic commands run by other users, plus logs and output
* View account details for ~700 Lyft staff
* View Cluster details
* View ""Customer metastore"" data, which includes details such as ""db_host"":""hive-metastore-production.cu3yieho9vrv.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com"",""db_user"":""lyftmaster"" (the password is also retrievable from the host server)
* Access the `lyft-modelbuilder` and `lyftqubole-iad` S3 buckets

Further Qubole operations that we didn't test, but could have serious impact include:
* Adding and removing users
* Regenerating SSH keys, changing AWS ID and Secret ID (to change where files are uploaded to, e.g. to an attackers AWS environment)

#Github
	
The GitHub SSH key allows access to private git repositories, including the following:
```
github.com/lyft/flyte/
github.com/lyft/flytedynamicjoboperator/
```
Further info can be retrieved using git log -p to observe historic changes from these repos.

# Reproducing Qubole Access:

The following cURL request retrieves the list of Lyft Qubole accounts:
```
curl -X GET -H ""X-AUTH-TOKEN:906e58d1dff048ed89684b086b89a84b294f312069fd4b5887c61e5cfc8dd646"" -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -H ""Accept: application/json"" \

Why: for now we have no idea whether we set correct CPU/Mem requests, would help a lot estimating the cost and potentially saving costs. As we soon want to have 500-800 executions per day, we'd like to optimise the resources before scaling up.

[P2] flyte admin - filter by tags
Why: for now when we use monitoring tool ( which calls the Flyte api ), we set a large ‘limit’ ( e.g. 1000 ) and filter the tags from the large list. But it seems having a limit ( ~ 3000, may because of the char limits from the json response) It would be great if it can directly filter the tag in API.

[P2] dynamic task for launch plan
Why: will be useful for tracking the launch plan executions from the ‘master task’. But for now we have a work around on this ( created `get-report` and `get-states` tasks after batch execution e.g. https://flyte.lyft.net/console/projects/trajectories/domains/development/executions/wrove63jtd ) so it’s not urgent.

This also affects further debug-ability like figuring out which subworkflows succeeded and failed. Basically, if the workflow fails, we cannot effectively rely on any node status which are most important in the first place when the workflow fails

We could update the scheduled workflow event dequeuing logic to trigger a call to delete a rule when no active launch plan versions exist. Unfortunately there's a possible race condition this exposes in the case of an end-user calling disable in one step, and then enable separately after that.

 

As a solution, [~matthewsmith] proposed adding an epoch to schedule names to distinguish them. Since we already want to make schedule names more descriptive (with some kind of truncated project & domain in the name) that work can fall under this work item."

The messages coming back from the API are decoded by protobufjs. But since all the fields in a proto messages are optional by convention, we don't have any assurance that the records are valid and usable. This has caused errors before on the client side.

 

Solution options:
 # Manual validation of the records and type-casting (`message as X`) or type-guarding (`: message is X`) to the stricter types present on the client side. This has the advantage of being flexible in the UI requirements, and the disadvantage of being difficult to keep in sync with the protobuf source of truth.
 # Automated validation via some type of schema definition stored on the client side (JSON Schema is one such option). This has the advantage of generating consistent code on the client side which is kept up-to-date automatically as the schema is updated, as well as providing a schema document that can be used to validate the JSON output from the API. It has the same disadvantage of being a separate solution which must be updated manually any time the API contract changes.
 # Switch the console to use protoc-generated JS/TS libraries and decorate all protobuf messages with the appropriate validation. This has the advantage of the validation rules being identical on both server and client (and updating automatically) as well as providing a generic solution for validation (call validate() on the message class coming back from the server). It has the disadvantage of requiring a non-trivial amount of work: Switching from protobufjs to protoc, enabling the TS output from protoc, updating console code to work with the new typings and decoding strategy.

Option 3 is ideal, but the amount of work necessary to do so is concerning (especially considering it may not work correctly and we might have to back it out)."

Options:
 # Convert it to a signed S3 link. This is probably not the right move because we need to verify the identity of a user before allowing them to download
 # Convert the s3:// protocol to an actual s3 link. It would be up to the user to ensure they are assuming the correct role to be able to download the file.

One such optimization is marking tasks as discoverable. To do that we can run a query like:
 * Count how many executions of a given not-discoverable task_instance with the same inputs & version that produced the same outputs.
We can then suggest:
""This task looks like it can safely be cached, consider marking it as discoverable. If the task does have side effects (e.g. updates dynamoDB), consider split it into two tasks to maximize discoverability. Marking tasks as discoverable can potentially reduce your overall execution time significantly. <insert some stat here to show that>"" "

Minor,Story,Open,MB-132,291838,,Render Logs directly in the UI,rschott,rschott,11-16-2017 8:13 AM,MB-1563,"We have enough information from activity execution entity to make calls directly to AWS to retrieve log stream events.

Accessing log streams requires specific permissions. These won't exist on the client (nor should they). But the server side could be granted that role and be a proxy for the logs.

So it might look something like this:
 * Client makes a request to UI server side to open logs for a specific execution, passing the execution ID. This opens a long-lived TCP request which will be used to stream the log back to the client
 * Server-side opens a connection to AWS to get the log stream for that execution. These have to be retrieved in chunks. Server-side begins streaming the chunks to the client
 * Server-side listens for (pings? Can AWS do push for these?) additional log stream lines and pushes them to the client as they are discovered.

Questions/Concerns:
 * This could be simpler if there was a way for the UI to retrieve a temporary token to use for AWS access. Can the server generate one of these and return it?
 * How do we know when the log stream has ended and we can close the connection to the client? Can we check for a specific string in it? 
 * Each one of these will consume a connection to the server and hold it open for what could be a long time. This could cause resource constraints, but we can always scale the UI servers to accomodate
 * Should we consider web sockets for this type of thing? We could have a mechanism where, while an active websocket connection is open watching a particular execution, the server-side will continue to poll for the latest logs and deliver them to whatever listeners are active. This has the benefit of only making the requests to AWS once if there are multiple listeners
 * If we _do_ use Websockets, this functionality is almost complicated enough to warrant spinning up a separate service to handle it."
