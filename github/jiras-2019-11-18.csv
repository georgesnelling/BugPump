MB-1903,1012329,Console sends `undefined` instead of `false` for unchecked toggle switches,MB-1838,"For workflows which take boolean values, the Console renders a toggle switch. When the toggle remains switched to ""off"", the resulting computed value is `undefined` instead of `false`. This translated to passing no value for the input when making the launch request.
For required inputs _with no default value_, that will result in a 400.

At the very least, if a boolean value is required and has no default, we should be translating an unchecked toggle to `false` to make sure the launch request succeeds.

MB-1073,507832,Figure out validation / default value implementation for JS,MB-1838,"Problem:

The messages coming back from the API are decoded by protobufjs. But since all the fields in a proto messages are optional by convention, we don't have any assurance that the records are valid and usable. This has caused errors before on the client side.

 

Solution options:
 # Manual validation of the records and type-casting (`message as X`) or type-guarding (`: message is X`) to the stricter types present on the client side. This has the advantage of being flexible in the UI requirements, and the disadvantage of being difficult to keep in sync with the protobuf source of truth.
 # Automated validation via some type of schema definition stored on the client side (JSON Schema is one such option). This has the advantage of generating consistent code on the client side which is kept up-to-date automatically as the schema is updated, as well as providing a schema document that can be used to validate the JSON output from the API. It has the same disadvantage of being a separate solution which must be updated manually any time the API contract changes.
 # Switch the console to use protoc-generated JS/TS libraries and decorate all protobuf messages with the appropriate validation. This has the advantage of the validation rules being identical on both server and client (and updating automatically) as well as providing a generic solution for validation (call validate() on the message class coming back from the server). It has the disadvantage of requiring a non-trivial amount of work: Switching from protobufjs to protoc, enabling the TS output from protoc, updating console code to work with the new typings and decoding strategy.

Option 3 is ideal, but the amount of work necessary to do so is concerning (especially considering it may not work correctly and we might have to back it out).",rschott,rschott,flyte_public,,Story,Major

MB-132,291838,Render Logs directly in the UI,MB-1563,"We have enough information from activity execution entity to make calls directly to AWS to retrieve log stream events.

Accessing log streams requires specific permissions. These won't exist on the client (nor should they). But the server side could be granted that role and be a proxy for the logs.

So it might look something like this:
 * Client makes a request to UI server side to open logs for a specific execution, passing the execution ID. This opens a long-lived TCP request which will be used to stream the log back to the client
 * Server-side opens a connection to AWS to get the log stream for that execution. These have to be retrieved in chunks. Server-side begins streaming the chunks to the client
 * Server-side listens for (pings? Can AWS do push for these?) additional log stream lines and pushes them to the client as they are discovered.

Questions/Concerns:
 * This could be simpler if there was a way for the UI to retrieve a temporary token to use for AWS access. Can the server generate one of these and return it?
 * How do we know when the log stream has ended and we can close the connection to the client? Can we check for a specific string in it? 
 * Each one of these will consume a connection to the server and hold it open for what could be a long time. This could cause resource constraints, but we can always scale the UI servers to accomodate
 * Should we consider web sockets for this type of thing? We could have a mechanism where, while an active websocket connection is open watching a particular execution, the server-side will continue to poll for the latest logs and deliver them to whatever listeners are active. This has the benefit of only making the requests to AWS once if there are multiple listeners

Flyte-cli has a great interface for getting the list of failures such that they can be piped into the relaunch workflows command, but relaunching doesn't allow us to specify a newer sha where we have fixed the problem causing the failures.  

Our current workaround involves writing a bit of python code, re-familiarizing with the flytekit sdk, etc. which takes us a couple hours every time it happens.

Request is to add a parameter to flyte-cli relaunch for workflow sha to use in lieu of the original one.  ",jzumbrum,matthewsmith,Cust_feature_req,flyte_public,Task,Major
MB-1885,1003754,FlyteAdmin stopped processing scheduling events,MB-1525,"Restarting admin fixed the issue. It seems there is some background executor go-routing which might be crashing and that is not handled well.
 Also logging for the scheduling jobs is very sparse and hard to debug

 - Have a low level plugin interface (Tasks)
 - Have a higher level FlyteK8s interface
 - Have a higher level Services interface

All these interfaces may exist with FlyteIDL or some other place.
The implementation of the machinery that controls them could probably exist with FlytePropeller. The implementations of the plugins could be supplied from various different repositories",kumare,habuelfutuh,Cust_feature_req,flyte_public,Task,Critical

Over half the time I spend interacting with the Flyte UI is spent copying/pasting inputs from one existing workflow into the ""Launch Workflow"" dialog box. With this bug, the new UI is practically unusable for me.
