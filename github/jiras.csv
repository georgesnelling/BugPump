Critical,Task,Open,MB-1940,1036094,,Workflow inputs randomly reorder themselves while I'm reading them,matthewsmith,kstaley,11-07-2019 4:56 PM,MB-1525,"When I click ""View Inputs and Outputs"" for a running Flyte workflow, the inputs are listed in a random order, and they _randomly reorder themselves every 10 seconds as I'm reading them_ (see attached video).

Over half the time I spend interacting with the Flyte UI is spent copying/pasting inputs from one existing workflow into the ""Launch Workflow"" dialog box (there is [another ticket|https://jira.lyft.net/browse/MB-1804] about that). With this bug, the new UI is practically unusable for me.

I think the inputs should consistently display in the same order that they appear in the ""Launch Workflow"" dialog."

     There are 8 production pipelines in the Flyte UI for the forecasting team at here: https://flyte-internal.lyft.net/console/projects/forecastingpipelines/workflows?domain=production

The below three are unused, could you please remove them from the UI?
